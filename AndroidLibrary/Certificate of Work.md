## Report - 1 : Design of a Mobile Charger



### Abstract

We designed a AC-DC rectifier circuit to charge a mobile phone on LTspice and then modelled it on KiCAD. We also designed a plastic enclosure for the charger circuitry on AutoCAD thus, completing the prototype. Further scope of work has also been explored.

### Summary of work
We divided the task of creating a functioning mobile charger into four components - Requirements, Specifications, Design and Enclosure. The Requirements team put together mechanical and electrical requirements for the charger. Mechanical requirements included temperature durability, area, thickness etc. while the electrical requirements included cable specifications, voltage and power output.

The Specifications team also divided the operation into Mechanical and Electrical parts. Mechanical specs included dimensions of socket, material to design body and cable and strain relief measures for the cable head. The electrical specifications included the input and output ratings of the charger.

In the Design part, we used Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) along with high frequency Fly-Back transformers to tackle the problem of heating up of transformer for low frequencies. We designed the circuit in LTspice and then shifted to KiCAD where we generated the PCB and 3D layout.

For the Enclosure part, we generated the casing of the charger, cable and USB port in AutoCAD and assembled them along with the 3D model of the charger.

We also made a comprehensive bill of materials explored new areas to improve efficiency, protect against surge current and use sustainable source of energy as input.

## Report -2 : Design of communicating Mulebots

### Abstract
We design a mule-bot, a robotic movable platform capable of carrying up to 40kg worth of items. Further, the mule-bot can follow the user, within 2m of distance, and evading obstacles. A system of wireless communication between the mulebots and a convoy mode are also introduced. We explore the further scope as well. Such a system can be heavily used in supermarkets or grocery stores.


### Summary of work
The whole work is divided into multiple parts and among different sub-groups. Firstly, the Requirements team put together electrical and mechanical requirements for the mulebot, which explored necessities like ability to go up slopes, Bluetooth pairing with the user as well as more advanced constraints like auto lock system to prevent theft. 

The Specifications team also divided the operation into Mechanical and Electrical parts. Mechanical specs included decisions regarding the weight of the bot, maximum achievable speed, diameter of the wheel and expected coefficient of friction. Electrical specifications team worked on formalising the exact models of the electronics (like motor driver, microcontroller, and sensors) that should be used for the CAD models and simulations.  

This work is followed by carefully establishing the flow of control in the system in terms of flowcharts and CAD models for the different components. The mulebot is also given additional components such as bar code scanners. The design of the mulebot is concluded with the provision for inductive charging using a wireless power transmitter. A convoy mode was also introduced which allow mulebots to autonomously form a convoy and return to the charging stations. The mulebots are equipped with NRF24L01 transceiver modules (Frequency- 2.4 GHz) to establish wireless connection between the Arduinos. Finally, the wireless connection with a central server is used to keep track of bot conditions like the weight it is carrying, whether it is occupied etc.

The project is concluded with the bill of materials required and the amount of working hours needed. We also explore the limitations of our work and suggest future improvements.
